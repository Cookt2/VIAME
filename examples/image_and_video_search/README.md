This folder contains an example for image search on top of an archive of images.

It currently requires Linux or Mac systems, and a VIAME build with SMQTK turned on.

The system can either be configured to perform queries over entire input images, or
on sub-regions of them by extracting descriptors in a windowed pattern or by running
an arbitrary object detector and chipping out regions around the detections.
