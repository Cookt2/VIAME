Image Search Using SMQTK
------------------------

This folder contains examples covering image search on top of an archive of images. <br>

It currently requires Linux or Mac systems, Windows is not fully supported. <br>

Building and running this examples requires: <br>

  (a) The python packages: numpy <br>
  (b) A VIAME build with VIAME_ENABLE_SMQTK turned ON <br>
  (c) An installation of MongoDB to run the web client <br>
  (d) Optionally: VIAME_ENABLE_YOLO flags to run the detector example <br>

The system can either be configured to perform queries via: <br>

 (a) Indexing descriptors around each full input image as-is. <br>
 (b) Tiling up each input image into fixed-size tiles. <br>
 (c) Indexing descriptors around detections generated by arbitrary detectors. <br>

First, reset_database.sh should be called to initialize a new database. <br>

Next, depending on which indexing paradigm you are using, one of the 3 ingesting shell
scripts can be called.
