Image Search Using SMQTK
------------------------

This folder contains examples covering image search on top of an archive of images. 

It currently requires Linux or Mac systems, Windows is not fully supported. 

Building and running this examples requires: 
|
|  (a) The python packages: numpy 
|  (b) A VIAME build with VIAME_ENABLE_SMQTK turned ON 
|  (c) An installation of MongoDB to run the web client 
|  (d) Optionally: VIAME_ENABLE_YOLO flags to run the detector example 
|
The system can either be configured to perform queries via: 
|
| (a) Indexing descriptors around each full input image as-is.
| (b) Tiling up each input image into fixed-size tiles. 
| (c) Indexing descriptors around detections generated by arbitrary detectors. 
|
First, reset_database.sh should be called to initialize a new database. 

Next, depending on which indexing paradigm you are using, one of the 3 ingesting shell
scripts can be called.

Which ingesting paradigm you want to use depends on a few factors: does your object
take up the entire image? Use (a). Are your object(s) a fixed known size in your image?
Use (b). Are your objects multiple scales? Use (c).
