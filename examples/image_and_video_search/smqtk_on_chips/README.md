This folder contains an example for image search on top of an archive of images.

It currently requires Linux or Mac systems and a VIAME build with SMQTK turned on.

Building and running this examples requires:

  (a) The python packages:
  (b) A VIAME build with VIAME_ENABLE_SMQTK turned ON
  (c) An installation of MongoDB to run the web client
  (d) Optionally: other VIAME_ENABLE flags to run the detector example

The system can either be configured to perform queries via:

 (a) Indexing descriptors around each full input image as-is.
 (b) Tiling up each input image into fixed-size tiles.
 (c) Indexing descriptors around detections generated by arbitrary detectors.
